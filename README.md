Simulate hundreds of chaotic dynamical systems.

## Usage

Import a model and run a simulation with default initial conditions and parameter values

    model = Lorenz()
    model.make_trajectory(1000)
    
    model = Logistic()
    model.make_trajectory(1000)
    
Modify a model's default parameter values

    model = Lorenz()
    model.gamma = 1
    model.ic = [0, 0, 0.2]
    model.make_trajectory(1000)

## Implementation

The right hand side of each dynamical equation is compiled using `numba`, wherever possible. Ensembles of trajectories are vectorized.

Attractor names, default parameter values, references, and other metadata are stored in parseable JSON database files.

The default integration step is stored in each continuous-time model's `dt` field. This integration timestep was chosen based on the highest significant frequency observed in the power spectrum, with significance being determined relative to [surrogate time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_data_testing). The `period` field contains the timescale associated with the dominant frequency in each system's power spectrum.

When using the `model.make_trajectory` method, integration is performed at the default `dt`. The integrated trajectory is then resampled based on the `period`. The resulting trajectories will have have consistant domant timescales across models, despite having different integration timesteps.

Default initial conditions are generated by running each model until moments of the autocorrelation function all become stationary.

## Contributing

If you know of any systems should be included, please feel free to submit an issue or pull request. The biggest bottleneck when adding new models is a lack of known parameter values and initial conditions, and so please provide a reference or code that contains all parameter values necessary to produce the claimed dynamics.

This module is named after [Mary Cartwright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Cartwright).

## Reporting

Dataset datasheets and metadata are reported using standard dataset documentation frameworks. See the dataset[`datasheet`](thom/metadata/datasheet.md)

## Development to-do list

+ Finish making all differential equations compilable
+ Speed up the delay equation implementation
+ Speed up multiple initial conditions for continuous time models
+ Add a separate jacobian database, and add an attribute that can be used to check if an analytical one exists
+ Align the initial phases, potentially by picking default starting initial conditions that lie on the attractor, but which are as close as possible to the origin
+ Add a `dimension` field with the number of dynamical variables
+ The advantage of maps are that they are deterministic but not differentiable

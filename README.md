# dysts

Simulate over a hundred chaotic systems.

![An embedding of all chaotic systems in the collection](dysts/data/fig_github.png)

## Basic Usage

Import a model and run a simulation with default initial conditions and parameter values

```python
from dysts.flows import Lorenz
model = Lorenz()
sol = model.make_trajectory(1000)
```

Modify a model's parameter values and re-integrate

```python
model = Lorenz()
model.gamma = 1
model.ic = [0, 0, 0.2]
sol = model.make_trajectory(1000)
```

Load a precomputed collection of time series

```python
from dysts.datasets import load_continuous

series_train = load_continuous(split="train").to_array(standardize=True)
```

Additional functionality and examples can be found in [`the demonstrations notebook.`](demos.ipynb). The full API documentation [can be found here](http://www.wgilpin.com/dysts/spbuild/html/index.html).

## Installation

Install locally from GitHub

    pip install pip install git+git://github.com/williamgilpin/dysts

Test that things are working

    python -m unittest

The key dependencies are

+ Python 3+
+ numpy
+ scipy

These optional dependencies are needed to reproduce some portions of this repository, such as benchmarking experiments and estimation of invariant properties of each dynamical system:

+ numba (speeds up generation of trajectories)
+ nolds (used for calculating the correlation dimension)
+ sdeint (used for adding noise to dynamics)
+ darts (used for forecasting benchmarks)
+ sktime (used for classification benchmarks)
+ tsfresh (used for statistical quantity extraction)
+ pytorch (used for neural network benchmarks)


## Contributing

**New systems.** If you know of any systems should be included, please feel free to submit an issue or pull request. The biggest bottleneck when adding new models is a lack of known parameter values and initial conditions, and so please provide a reference or code that contains all parameter values necessary to reproduce the claimed dynamics. Because there are an infinite number of chaotic systems, we currently are only including systems that have appeared in published work.

**Development and Maintainence.** We are extremely grateful for any help or advice. See the to-do list below for some of the ongoing work.

## Contents

+ Code to generate benchmark forecasting and training experiments are included in [`benchmarks`](dysts/benchmarks)
+ Pre-computed time series with training and test partitions are included in [`data`](dysts/dysts/data)
+ The raw definitions metadata for all chaotic systems are included in the database file [`chaotic_attractors`](dysts/dysts/data/chaotic_attractors.json). The Python implementations of differential equations can be found in [`the flows module`](dysts/dysts/flows.py)

## Benchmarks

The benchmarks reported in our preprint can be found in [`benchmarks`](dysts/benchmarks). An overview of the contents of the directory can be found in [`BENCHMARKS.md`](dysts/BENCHMARKS.md), while individual task areas are summarized in corresponding Jupyter Notebooks within the top level of the directory.

## Implementation Notes

+ Currently there are 131 continuous time models, including several delay diffential equations. There is also a separate module with 10 discrete maps, which is currently being expanded. 
+ The right hand side of each dynamical equation is compiled using `numba`, wherever possible. Ensembles of trajectories are vectorized where needed.
+ Attractor names, default parameter values, references, and other metadata are stored in parseable JSON database files. Parameter values are based on standard or published values, and default initial conditions were generated by running each model until the moments of the autocorrelation function all become stationary.
+ The default integration step is stored in each continuous-time model's `dt` field. This integration timestep was chosen based on the highest significant frequency observed in the power spectrum, with significance being determined relative to [random phase surrogates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_data_testing). The `period` field contains the timescale associated with the dominant frequency in each system's power spectrum. When using the `model.make_trajectory()` method with the optional setting `resample=True`, integration is performed at the default `dt`. The integrated trajectory is then resampled based on the `period`. The resulting trajectories will have have consistant dominant timescales across models, despite having different integration timesteps.

## Acknowledgements

+ Two existing collections of named systems can be found on the webpages of [J&uuml;rgen Meier](http://www.3d-meier.de/tut19/Seite1.html) and [J. C. Sprott](http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/sprott.htm). The current version of `dysts` contains all systems from both collections.
+ Several of the analysis routines (such as calculation of the correlation dimension) use the library [nolds](https://github.com/CSchoel/nolds). If re-using the fractal dimension code that depends on `nolds`, please be sure to credit that library and heed its license. The Lyapunov exponent calculation is based on the QR factorization approach used by [Wolf et al 1985](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0167278985900119) and [Eckmann et al 1986](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.34.4971), with implementation details adapted from conventions in the Julia library [DynamicalSystems.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DynamicalSystems.jl/)


## Ethics & Reporting

Dataset datasheets and metadata are reported using the dataset documentation guidelines described in [Gebru et al 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010); please see our preprint for a full dataset datasheet and other information. We note that all datasets included here are mathematical in nature, and do not contain human or clinical observations. If any users become aware of unintended harms that may arise due to the use of this data, we encourage reporting them by submitting an issue on this repository.


## Development to-do list

A partial list of potential improvements in future versions

+ Speed up the delay equation implementation
+ + We need to roll our own implementation of DDE23 in the `utils` module.
+ Improve calculations of Lyapunov exponents for delay systems
+ Implement multivariate multiscale entropy and re-calculate for all attractors
+ Add a method for parallel integrating multiple systems at once, based on a list of names and a set of shared settings
+ + Can use multiprocessing for a few systems, but greater speedups might be possible by compiling all right hand sides into a single function acting on a large vector.
+ + Can also use this same utility to integrate multiple initial conditions for the same model
+ Add a separate jacobian database file, and add an attribute that can be used to check if an analytical one exists. This will speed up numerical integration, as well as potentially aid in calculating Lyapunov exponents.
+ Align the initial phases, potentially by picking default starting initial conditions that lie on the attractor, but which are as close as possible to the origin
+ Expand and finalize the discrete `dysts.maps` module
+ + Maps are deterministic but not differentiable, and so not all analysis methods will work on them. Will probably need a decorator to declare whether utilities work on flows, maps, or both
+ Switch stochastic integration to a newer package, like `torchsde` or `sdepy`

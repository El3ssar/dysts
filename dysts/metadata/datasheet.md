### Dataset documentation and datasheet

A dataset nutrition label reports metadata and relevant summary statistics for all datasets. The notebook ['nutrition_label.ipynb'](nutrition_label.ipynb) includes examples for retrieving metadata from each dynamical system, as well as computing relevant summary statistics.

Here we address the questions included in the 

### Motivation

**Purpose,** This dataset was created for the purpose of providing a generative benchmark for time series mining applications, in which arbitrary synthetic data can be generated using a deterministic process.

**Creator and Funding.** This repository was created by William Gilpin, with support from the NSF-Simons Center for Quantitative Biology at Harvard University, as well as the University of Texas at Austin. No special funding was solicited for this particular project.

### Composition

**Instances.** Each instance in this dataset comprises a set of nonlinear differential equations describing a chaotic process, a set of standard parameter values and initial conditions, a citation to a published source (when available), and an example trajectory generated by the system

**Scope.** Each instance corresponds to a particular realization of a dynamical system, based on previously-published parameter values and initial conditions. In principle, an infinite number of additional chaotic systems exists; our dataset seeks to provide a representative sample of published systems.

**Labels.** Each trajectory and system contains metadata describing its provenance, however there is not a particular label associated with each trajectory. Certain special classes of systems with special mathematical properties have additional fields in their metadata, which could be used as labels, such as `hamiltonian` or `nonautonomous`

**Missing Information.** For systems in which a reference citation or additional context is unavailable, the corresponding field in the metadata file is left blank.

**Instance Relationships.** Each instance corresponds to a different dynamical system.

**Data Splits.** No splits are pre-specified, because (in principle) arbitrary amounts of training, validation, and testing data can be generated for each dynamical system. Splits can either be performed by holding out some timepoints, or (for multivariate systems) by splitting the set of dynamical variables.

**Errors and Noise.** If any errors or redundancies are identified, we encourage users to submit an issue via GitHub. Noise can be added to the trajectories either by adding random values to each observed timepoint (ie measurement noise), or performing a stochastic simulation (ie stochastic dynamics)

**External dependencies.** The dataset is self-contained.

## Benchmark experiments

Summaries of the different benchmark experiment files.

# Forecasting

+ `find_hyperparameters.py` computes hyperparameters across all forecasting models separately for each dynamical system
+ `compute_benchmarks.py` uses the best hyperparameters to train and score a models on the test data.

# Tranfer learning

+ `importance_sampling.py` uses importance sampling to improve training on an LSTM forecasting model
